<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Assignment #1: Notepad</font></h1>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Due Tuesday, January 29, 
8pm</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With this file, you will find source code that I found on 
the web for a Notepad application written in Java.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">to compile, run: javac *.java</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">to run, leave the Notepad directory, make sure that 
  Notepad is in your classpath, and run java Notepad.Notepad</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Note: to make your life easier, I modified the code so that it compiles into a package and 
that icons are accessed as resources. Further I restructured the code so that it 
should be easy to convert into Jak format -- namely, I eliminated nested 
classes.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">Run Notepad.&nbsp; You'll see lots of possible features 
that are optional.&nbsp; Your assignment is:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">to create an AHEAD model for Notepad, clearly identifying what 
  features are optional.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">use ATS tools (such as modelexplorer) to &quot;pull apart&quot; 
  Notepad so that you can create variations.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">demonstrate how a product-line could be created from 
  your design.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">Keep the following points in mind.</font></p>
<ol>
	<li><font face="Arial"><b>PLEASE READ THE AHEAD TUTORIAL/MANUALS!</b>&nbsp;
	</font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial">Convert the Java code to Jak code.&nbsp; This is 
  largely done by placing all code in a single directory and replacing the 
  statement &quot;package Notepad;&quot; with &quot;layer Base;&quot; (or whatever name you want to 
  give the constant of your model), and replacing super(&quot;...&quot;) with Super(String)(&quot;...&quot;).&nbsp;
	</font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial">Remember, when you compose layers, you will be building 
  a package whose name is the name of the equation.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial">This is a simple and single application where 
  variations are something of your own creation.&nbsp; Normally, variations are 
  characteristics of a domain and not something that you invent for the sake of 
  creating work.&nbsp; In fact, typical domains have different features that are 
  incompatible.&nbsp; You may have to be creative to define such features. (They 
  exist -- you figure out what they might be). </font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial">Applications that are not written with features in mind 
  may need to be restructured (possibly significantly) to make AHEAD generation 
  (or any generation technique, for that matter) to work.&nbsp; So, don't be 
  surprised that you will have to restructure the code in order to match the 
  capabilities of your model.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial">AHEAD tools generally do not work with nested classes 
  -- only one Java (or rather Jak) class is defined per file.&nbsp; If you 
  absolutely must use nested classes (or nested interfaces), use pure Java 
  (i.e., no extended-Java) statements.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial">Customizing small files often needs String constants as 
  parameters.&nbsp; AHEAD tools do not (at present) allow you to customize a 
  layer by parameterizing it with one or more constants.&nbsp; For now, don't 
  worry about String constant customizations.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><b><font face="Arial">You are to submit to me via email a zip file that 
contains the following:</font></b></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">your model directory, with features and equation files</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">an html page that explains each unit of your model and 
  each equation file</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">a bash script that builds each notepad variation.&nbsp; 
  The bash script must be idiot proof!</font></li>
</ol>

<h3><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Your Submission</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The goal of this assignment is (a) to become familiar with 
AHEAD&nbsp; tools, (b) to become familiar with how an application can be 
partitioned into required &amp; optional layers, and (c) how the pieces can be 
recomposed. So, if you have 6 layers, you might have 2**5 possible combinations. 
I don't want to see or run 2**5 combinations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In your hand-in document, you should explain how many legal 
possibilities you have, give say 3 or 4 (tops) equations as examples that you 
think best illustrate the above points, and a bash script that builds them.&nbsp; You 
might also explain how &quot;fine&quot; you might be able to take your decomposition -- 
where &quot;termination&quot; stops when finer distinctions can't be reasonably justified.<br>
<br>
It is possible that there might be slight differences in the composed tools -- 
menu items might not be the same as the original.&nbsp; That's OK.</font><br>
&nbsp;</p>
